## **1. Introduction**

The management of **[CA Operator]** recognizes that the continuity of essential CA services depends on **effective certificate revocation and replacement processes**. These processes are dependent on robust IT infrastructure, effective customer communication, and rapid response capabilities.

To mitigate risks associated with a **Mass Revocation Event (MRE)**—which could cause disruption to customers, financial losses, and damage to trust—management has authorized the development, implementation, and maintenance of this **Mass Revocation Incident Preparation and Testing Plan (MRIP&TP).**

The MRIP&TP is aligned with **[CA Operator]** policies, compliance obligations, and industry best practices. It provides a framework for MRE response, customer communication, certificate replacement, revocation, and plan testing in advance of an MRE. This plan also aims to **ensure compliance** with industry and root store requirements, such as the CA/Browser Forum TLS Baseline Requirements and Mozilla Root Store Policy.

## **2. Mission and Objectives**

The mission of this plan is to **ensure a well-coordinated, rapid, and effective response to a Mass Revocation Event** while maintaining compliance and minimizing disruptions.

Plan objectives are to:

- **Define clear roles and responsibilities** for the teams assigned with handling MREs;
- **Identify critical processes and time-sensitive milestones** for mass revocation preparedness;
- **Provide timely, clear communication** to customers and other stakeholders to **minimize disruptions** to the ecosystem and third parties;
- **Develop and document certificate revocation** strategies and procedures to ensure **swift certificate replacement and** compliance with revocation deadlines;
- **Report any delayed revocations** to Bugzilla; and
- **Improve readiness** through effective training, testing, and continuous improvement of mass revocation procedures.

## **3. Scope**

This plan applies to the **scoping, implementation, execution, review, training, testing, and improvement** of **mass revocation processes** at **[CA Operator]**. It supports compliance with Mozilla Root Store Policy Section 6.1.3 and covers:

- Maintenance of a well-documented and actionable mass revocation plan;
- Rapid communication with customer and affected third parties; 
- Certificate replacement strategies;
- Revocation execution and publication of certificate status;
- Operational coordination and team responsibilities;
- Compliance with CA/Browser Forum requirements;
- Demonstrating implementation and feasibility through annual testing consisting of simulations, tabletop exercises, or controlled test environments;
- Incorporating lessons learned by making plan improvements; and
- Third-party assessment and external compliance evaluation.

## **4. Definition and Declaration of an MRE**

A **Mass Revocation Event (MRE)** is defined as:

*The revocation of a substantial number of certificates within a relatively short timeframe due to a common cause, compliance requirement, or security incident. The impact threshold is based on the CA’s total issuance volume and operational scale.*

A Mass Revocation Event would be triggered, and this plan will be activated, based on:

- **Absolute Volume Impact** – Affects **≥** 100 certificates;
- **Relative Issuance Impact** – Affects ≥1% of the CA’s active TLS certificates;
- **Timeframe Impact** – Requires revocation within timeframes set forth in section 4.9.1.1 of the TLS Baseline Requirements; or
- **Operational Burden** – Requires major customer outreach, urgent operational changes, or compliance reporting;

Or in response to any of the following:

- **Compromise or suspected compromise** of a CA private key;
- **Compliance failures** affecting a significant number of certificates; or
- **Discovery of a major vulnerability** impacting server private keys (e.g., HeartBleed).

The **Management Team** will assess and declare a Mass Revocation Event based on these criteria.

## **5. Decision Points and Strategies**

### **5.1 Initial Assessment and Activation**

Upon identification of a potential MRE, the **Management Team** will:

1. **Assess the incident’s scope and severity** against the defined MRE criteria;
2. **Issue an internal alert** to notify team members of possible activation;
3. **Determine affected certificate population** and impacted customers;
4. **Estimate timelines** required to perform notification, replacement, and revocation;
5. **Initiate a conference call** to validate findings and coordinate response; and
6. **Mobilize internal teams** and notify external stakeholders as needed.

**[Note: If event categorization will help identify different response strategies, then a section can be inserted here to outline different event types and the specific response procedures that follow the Response Phases outlined below.]**

### **5.2 Response Phases**

An MRE will be managed in **four structured phases**:

#### **Phase 1 – Customer Communication**

- Issue **early notification** to affected customers.
- Provide **guidance on certificate replacement** timelines and procedures.
- Engage **technical support teams** for high-priority customers.

#### **Phase 2 – Certificate Replacement**

**[Important Note: Because past delayed revocation incidents have revealed that certificate replacement is often the most troublesome, complex, and time-sensitive aspect of a mass revocation event, this section of the plan must be carefully developed, with detailed procedures that address automation, customer support, prioritization of critical systems, and fallback strategies. The CA operator should ensure that this part of the plan accounts for potential bottlenecks, customer challenges, and any necessary tooling improvements to facilitate timely replacement and certificate revocation.]**

- Automate renewal or reissuance where possible.
- Offer manual assistance for complex cases.
- Monitor progress and address replacement delays.

#### **Phase 3 – Certificate Revocation**

- Execute mass revocation in compliance with industry timelines.
- Publish updated CRLs and OCSP responses within expected timeframes.
- Report delayed revocations if necessary.

#### **Phase 4 – Post-Mortem and Improvement**

- Conduct an **internal review** of response effectiveness.
- Document **lessons learned** and areas for improvement.
- Update **MRIP&TP** based on findings.

## **6. Response Team Organization and Responsibilities**

Effective execution of this plan depends on clear team roles.
