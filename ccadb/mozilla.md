# Mozilla CCADB Policy #

*Version 0.0.1 (draft)*

Mozilla’s root program may be contacted via the email address
[certificates@mozilla.org](mailto:certificates@mozilla.org).

## Additional Requirements ##

* If the revocation of an intermediate certificate chaining up to a root in
Mozilla’s root program is due to a security concern, as well as performing the
actions in the Common Policy, the CA should additionally email the details to
[security@mozilla.org](mailto:security@mozilla.org).
* Audits must be conducted and updated audit information provided **annually**.

## Surveys ##

Mozilla may conduct a survey of CAs from time to time using the CCADB. CAs are
required to respond to the surveys with accurate information, within the
timescale defined in the survey.
