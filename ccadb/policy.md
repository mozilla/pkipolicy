# Common CCADB Policy #

*Version 0.0.5 (draft)*

Several Web PKI root store operators (“Stores”) have collaborated to create
the Common Certificate Authority Database (CCADB), a data repository of
certificate and Certificate Authority (CA) information. CAs who wish to be
included in participating stores will need to maintain certain information in
the CCADB. This document explains what is required of CAs who are required by
Store policy to use the CCADB.

Stores may have their own additional CCADB-related requirements. For each root
certificate, CAs must comply with the additional requirements pertaining to the
Stores which contain that certificate.

This document does not cover how to obtain write access to the CCADB or how to
use the CCADB’s web interface. Those topics are outside its scope. CAs should
contact an appropriate Store for assistance.

## 1. General Provisions ##

Regardless of more specific provisions in these requirements, CAs have an
overarching responsibility to keep the information in the CCADB about
themselves, their operations and their certificates accurate, and make updates
in a timely fashion.

All data in the CCADB may be made public or semi-public in a variety of forms;
CAs should not place any information in the CCADB which they wish to keep
confidential. However, Stores are not obliged to publish any CCADB information.

## 2. Contact Information ##

CAs are required to provide the name, email address and an office-hours phone
number of a Primary Point of Contact (POC), and at least one other POC, who may
or may not be Primary. CAs may optionally designate further POCs, supplying at
least one contact method for each. CAs must also supply one or two non-personal
contact email aliases which are more likely to continue working as personnel
change; these are maintained as part of the CA’s organizational entry.

All Primary POCs should be authorized to speak for and to bind the CA that they
represent. At least one of the Primary POCs will hold a CA Community license;
other POCs may also apply to a Store to be issued one. Those Primary POCs with
a CA Community license are ultimately responsible for keeping CCADB data
up-to-date for their CA.

Notification of security and audit-related issues will be emailed to all POCs
and the email aliases; CAs are advised to supply sufficient POCs that will
enable them to respond to an issue promptly.

If POC or email alias information needs to be updated, the CA should notify one
of the Stores containing their root certificates, because this information may
only be edited by Stores. See the Store policy documents for Store contact
information.

## 3. Root Certificates ##

A root certificate is a certificate which is capable of issuing new
certificates, which a CA designates as a trust anchor. It will usually be
self-signed. CAs are required to maintain correct and current information about
their root certificates.

If root certificate information, including audit information, needs to be
updated, the CA should notify one of the Stores containing the certificate,
because this information may only be edited by Stores. See the Store policy
documents for Store contact information.

## 4. Intermediate Certificates ##

An intermediate certificate is a certificate capable of issuing new
certificates that is not a root certificate. Intermediate certificates that
chain up to root certificate(s) in the CCADB and that are not exempt must be
entered into the database. This includes certificates that are revoked. For
newly-created intermediate certificates, this must happen before the
certificate begins issuing publicly-trusted certificates.

Intermediate certificates are exempt from being added to the CCADB if at least
one of the following is true:

* The certificate has the Extended Key Usage (EKU) extension and the EKU does
  not include the anyExtendedKeyUsage or id-kp-serverAuth KeyPurposeIds; or
* The certificate has the Extended Key Usage (EKU) extension and the EKU
  includes the anyExtendedKeyUsage or id-kp-serverAuth KeyPurposeIds, and the
  certificate is name constrained as described in section 7.1.5 of the
  [CA/Browser Forum's Baseline
  Requirements](https://cabforum.org/baseline-requirements-documents/); or
* The root certificate(s) to which the certificate chains up is/are not trusted
  for server authentication by any Store; or
* The certificate has expired.

When an intermediate certificate chains up to two included root certificates,
each instance (i.e. PEM data) of the certificate only needs to be included in
the CCADB once.

If an intermediate certificate is revoked, the CCADB must be updated to mark it
as revoked, giving the reason why, within 24 hours for a security incident, and
within 7 days for any other reason.

## 5. Policies, Practices and Audit Information ##

In the records for both root certificates and intermediate certificates, CAs
are required to provide details of the Certificate Policy (CP) and/or
Certificate Practice Statement (CPS) documents relating to that certificate,
and also statements of attestation of their conformance to various requirements
and other operational criteria (“audits”), those statements being made by a
competent independent party or parties. These documents are hosted elsewhere
and the URLs are stored in the CCADB. The URLs to such CPs, CPSes and audits,
and any metadata about them such as the name of the auditor or the date of the
audit, need to be updated as new information become available. For technical
reasons, URLs to audit statements need to point to a PDF file.

The entry for each intermediate certificate has "Audits Same as Parent" and
"CP/CPS Same as Parent" checkboxes. When those are checked, the details do not
need to be duplicated from the parent cert. However, the intermediate
certificate must be specifically listed in the audit statements of the parent
certificate.

URLs for the following documents are required for each certificate:

* Certificate Policy (CP)
* Certificate Practice Statement (CPS)
* Standard audit (WebTrust or ETSI)
* Baseline Requirements (BR) audit (if the certificate is capable of issuing
  TLS/SSL server certificates)
* Extended Validation (EV) audit (if applicable)

## 6. Mailshots ##

From time to time, a Store may use the CCADB to send information to CAs.
Mailshots will be sent to at least the Primary POC and the email aliases, and
may also go to one or more of the other POCs; the exact recipient list is
defined by the Store sending the information.
